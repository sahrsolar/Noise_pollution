# Quiet Please!  
### Leveraging Data Science, Machine Learning, and Visualization Techniques to Map and Mitigate Urban Noise Pollution

## Overview  
This repository contains Python scripts developed for my master's dissertation, *Quiet Please! Leveraging Data Science, Machine Learning, and Visualization Techniques to Map and Mitigate Urban Noise Pollution*. The project explores urban noise pollution using data science methodologies, machine learning models, and visualisation techniques to analyse noise levels and propose mitigation strategies.
